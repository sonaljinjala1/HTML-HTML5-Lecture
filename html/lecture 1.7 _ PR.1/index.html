						<P><b>Sunshine Worldwide School endeavors providing real life education and towards this is committed in making the school an excellent learning community.</b> To be able to provide this ecosystem, it has adopted the International Baccalaureate curriculum for Nursery to Class 5 and thereafter follows the Central Board of Secondary Education. All learning activities across the school are guided by the National Curriculum Framework of India. The school is an authorized IB World School presently. At the core of all learning activity in the school lies the acknowledgement of each learner’s uniqueness and accordingly we strive to go an extra mile to ascertain that the curriculum is age-appropriate at each level. Our focus is drawn on enhancing the student’s individual strengths and prepare them for the future. Educators are onboarded post due diligence on experience and ability to steer the philosophically guided learning at the school, are personally involved and interact regularly with the students, helping them realize their strengths & capabilities. We believe that every child is unique.</p><br>
						
						Schools across the world have been striving towards making Education an experience that would help children truly stand on their own as competent and independent Individuals. There have been several methods that schools have been adopting as to make a name for themselves. After all, what is an Educational Institution without young bright learners?<br><br>
 
						SWS is the only school across India to have initiated the Sunshine Corporate Business World in a school setting. While the main idea behind the Corporate Model was to get students ready for the Corporate World by giving them a hands-on experience of how it works in reality, this initiative has also been specifically crucial in imparting life skills such as collaboration, critical and creative thinking, financial literacy, public speaking, and so much more.In an attempt to further comprehend the vision behind the SWS Corporate Model, the MD of one of Corporate Model’s companies Sunshine Publications, Ms. Angel Abraham, interviewed the Founder-Director Mr. Deepak Khaitan who has been the visionary behind this and more initiatives towards reforming Education.

						“Giving learners a practical exposure would change everything; it’s not just about preparing children for jobs; it’s about getting them to think like entrepreneurs. Whether they do a job, a business or any other profession; one should know how to take risks, have the decision-making ability, negotiation skills, research skills, and make sense of whatever it is that they are doing,” says Mr. Khaitan.<br>

So we hope to inculcate all the values in our children along with their holistic development so that they grow up to be responsible and passionate individuals.<br><br>

						Along with this we also aim at developing our children with values so that they learn about their roots and grow along with it. Sports and physical activities play a major role in developing skills which would be helpful in life always and focusing on them at this tender age is the most important aspect of quality education.<br><br>

						Application Based Education (ABE) When ABE is infused with problem solving, critical thinking & communication skills, we achieve results that are leaps & bounds ahead of the traditional techniques. Our experience proves that this approach not only helps a student grasp the subject quicker, but also facilitates in faster brain and sensory development.<br><br>Benjamin Franklin once said, “Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn.” And we swear by this approach. Our learners have shown tremendous growth when the subjects are Activity Based. So, at Sunshine, every individual student has the freedom to conduct their own research, keeping in mind that the result will always lead to an open outcome. The philosophy of Sunshine Worldwide School has its core in the ideology of competence building without competition, making our school ONE OF A KIND. We encourage competition with oneself, to develop a structured, positive growth focused on self-improvement<br><br>
