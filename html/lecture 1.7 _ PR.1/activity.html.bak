				<CENTER><p><h3>Inclusive Education must become a norm.</h3></p></CENTER>
 
				<p>Inclusive learning is an instructional technique in which Educators employ a variety of learning methods to individually meet the needs of each learner according to their needs. These needs may be existing knowledge, learning style, interest, and understanding of the subject.
				A SWS, we firmly believe in making education an inclusive experience for all our learners. Children may not understand as to why they learn certain things at a certain pace, but we as educators must take it upon ourselves to ensure that no child feels excluded, in any way. These things leave a long-lasting impact on children’s mind and as an Educational Institution, we ensure inclusivity in true sense.</p>

				<p>More so, the purpose of inclusive learning is to create an equal learning advantage for all learners and to bridge the gap between the seemingly high performers and low performers in the classroom. Before introducing a course to a class, it is important to note that some learners may have a certain level of knowledge on the subject, while others may have a general understanding of the subject. Conversely, some students may be completely new to the topic.</p>

				<p>One of the most poignant questions that Educators must ask themselves is – What do we as Educators should bring to our classrooms?</p>

				<p>At SWS, we believe the answer to that questions is, Goals.</p>
				
				<p>Educators must reflect upon the kind of goals they go to their classrooms with; it would most certainly help strengthen a foundation to the core component of imparting Education– FMS (Few, More, Some). There are three key points that we must remember as we enter any classroom filled with young minds – engagement, resources and representation, and action.</p>
				
				<p>The above then must be catered to by Content (to be related with representation), process (How does one Engage with content), and product (connection).</p>
				
				<p>In a world that we live in today, Educational Institutions must acknowledge that there is a need to design a plan that is inclusive of every learner in class.</p>
				
				At SWS, every Educator would have the following key pointers in the Lesson Plans:<br>
				
				Task 1 – Who are my Few, Most, and Some?<br>
				Task 2 – Once we recognise the Few, Most, and Some – We colour code them through files.<br>
				Task 3 – Prepare a tier content (content file, product file, and process file)<br>
				Task 4 – Tier content for the Unit through concepts (divide concepts according to FMS)<br>
				Task 4b –Make a list of supplementary matters required for the Unit (No videos, visuals, could be activity based such as newspaper reading, book reading etc)<br>
				Task 4c – Presentation style – Videos, Ted Talks, etc.<br>
				Task 4d – Collaboration with special Educator for supply of guided content.<br>
				
				<p>A Learning contract must be incorporated into every Unit, I.e. a common ground for both learners and educators in terms of comprehension of concepts and completion of tasks.</p>
				
				<p>The Lesson Plans would further emphasise on the tiered activities based on goals – simple to complex and concrete to complex.</p>

				<p>This approach has been a great learning curve for all of us at SWS because a classroom with all these elements would truly be balanced and cater to every child in every way possible. This is the ideal way of approaching Education and we most certainly practice this in all our classes.</p>
