		<center><p><h2><u>HISTORY - BIRTH OF SCHOOL</u></h2></p></center>
		<p><strong>Sunshine Worldwide School,</strong> founded in June 2003, was one of the first CBSE schools with IB learning methodologies in Goa. Motivated to build a safe and creative learning space for children, the late Mrs. Swaran Khaitan, along with her son Deepak and daughter-in-law Sapna Khaitan brought this school to life.<br><br>

		One of the key ideas behind the creation of Sunshine Worldwide School was to run a school with a difference. With Mummy Ji as the Chief Promoter and Deepak and Sapna Khaitan at the helm of affairs, Sunshine Worldwide School was a CBSE school in Goa where children felt like they had a home away from home.<br><br>
		
		We understand the importance of your child’s holistic development and this is why we at Sunshine Worldwide School strive to create a happy, supportive atmosphere that follows an evolved creative system of education. We believe in stimulating your child’s intellectual, mental, physical, emotional, and social abilities with our curriculum that involves both programs inside and well as outside the classroom. Following IB school standards, we also implement the use of technology in our classrooms to further facilitate and enhance the quality of education your child receives.<br><br>

		In the early years, the emphasis is on Inquiry through play. Children actively create meaning from their interactions with people and their environments. These meanings are revisited and revised in light of new experiences and further learning. As an IB PYP school in Goa, we follow a practical method of teaching wherein our learners think critically, ask questions and develop research skills. We concentrate on what your child ‘Can Do’ rather than what your child ‘Knows’, thereby focusing on their ability to apply the knowledge taught to them. We also teach our learners the value of giving their fullest, whether it is in their education or hobbies so that the outcomes are as expected.<br><br>

		At Sunshine Worldwide School, we firmly believe in the all-round development of your child. Each of our learners possess unique talents, we seek to discover and nurture them so that these hidden gifts may grow and reach their full potential. We also aim at helping children productively channel their enthusiastic spirits through our various programs and events held throughout the school year. Teamwork is the heart of every activity in our school. We teach our learners to recognise and appreciate the accomplishments of one another, thus promoting lifelong social skills. We encourage our learners to practice, perform, review and prepare their work which eventually leads to their self-improvement.<br><br>
