					<p><h3><i>The term “organic” refers to the way agricultural products are grown and processed. While the regulations vary from country to country, in the U.S., organic crops must be grown without the use of synthetic herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers, or bioengineered genes (GMOs).</i></h3></p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3><em>Organic livestock raised for meat, eggs, and dairy products must be raised in living conditions accommodating their natural behaviors (such as the ability to graze on pasture) and fed organic feed and forage. They may not be given antibiotics, growth hormones, or any animal by-products.</em></h3>

					<h3>How your food is grown or raised can have a major impact on your mental and emotional health as well as the environment. Organic foods often have more beneficial nutrients, such as antioxidants, than their conventionally-grown counterparts and people with allergies to foods, chemicals, or preservatives may find their symptoms lessen or go away when they eat only organic foods.</h3>
				</li>
				<li>	
					<h3><strong>Organic produce contains fewer pesticides.</strong>Chemicals such as synthetic fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides are widely used in conventional agriculture and residues remain on (and in) the food we eat.</h3>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3><strong>Organic food is often fresher</strong> because it doesn't contain preservatives that make it last longer. Organic produce is sometimes (but not always, so watch where it is from) produced on smaller farms nearer to where it is sold.</h3>
				</li>
				<li>	
					<h3><strong>Organic farming tends to be better for the environment.</strong> Organic farming practices may reduce pollution, conserve water, reduce soil erosion, increase soil fertility, and use less energy. Farming without synthetic pesticides is also better for nearby birds and animals as well as people who live close to farms.</h3>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3><strong>Organically raised animals are NOT given antibiotics, growth hormones, or fed animal byproducts.</strong> Feeding livestock animal byproducts increases the risk of mad cow disease (BSE) and the use of antibiotics can create antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. Organically-raised animals tend to be given more space to move around and access to the outdoors, which helps to keep them healthy.Organic meat and milk can be richer in certain nutrients. Results of a 2016 European study show that levels of certain nutrients, including omega-3 fatty acids, were up to 50 percent higher in organic meat and milk than in conventionally raised versions.<h3>

				The Indian Organic Food Market is projected to grow from USD177.14 million in FY2020 to USD553.87 million in FY2026 advancing with a CAGR of 21.00% by FY2026, on account of favorable government policies supporting organic farming coupled with rising land area under organic cultivation.

				Online availability of organic food products and shifting consumer preference towards organic food are among the major factors expected to boost the demand for organic food products in India during the forecast period. Expanding marketing and distribution channels coupled with increasing number of health-conscious people are also anticipated to fuel organic food consumption in India until FY2026.

				Furthermore, increase in awareness regarding the food people eat has resulted in the uplift of the organic food market. Consumers in India have started paying attention to their health, the quality and nutrient content of the food they eat. Due to health concerns, consumers are shifting towards the organic food gradually, which is further giving boost to the organic food market in India.</h3></strong>

				<h3><strong>Organic food, fresh or processed food produced by organic farming methods. Organic food is grown without the use of synthetic chemicals, such as human-made pesticides and fertilizers, and does not contain genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Organic foods include fresh produce, meats, and dairy products as well as processed foods such as crackers, drinks, and frozen meals. The market for organic food has grown significantly since the late 20th century, becoming a multibillion dollar industry with distinct production, processing, distribution, and retail systems.</h3></strong>

				Organic food policies were created largely to provide a certification system with specific rules regarding production methods, and only products that follow the guidelines are allowed to use the certified organic labels. In the United States, the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 began the process of establishing enforceable rules to mandate how agricultural products are grown, sold, and labeled. The regulations concerning organic food and organic products are based on a National List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances, which is a critical aspect of certified organic farming methods. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) regulates organic production through its National Organic Program (NOP), which serves to facilitate national and international marketing and sales of organically produced food and to assure consumers that USDA certified organic products meet uniform standards. To this end, NOP established three specific labels for consumers on organic food products: “100% organic,” “organic,” or “made with organic ***,” which signify that a product’s ingredients are 100 percent, at least 95 percent, or 70 percent organic, respectively. Noncertified products cannot use the USDA organic seal, and violators face significant fines and penalties.</h3></strong>
